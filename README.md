I've just completed these:

* [ECDSA-CSR.js](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/ecdsa-csr.js)
* [eckles.js](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/eckles.js) - JWK-to-PEM and PEM-to-JWK for EC / ECDSA P-256 and P-384

I've got working prototypes for the RSA variants as well and I'm in the middle of cleaning them up to publish.
